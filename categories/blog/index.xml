      <title>RC for two days</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a lot of thought and planning I came down to RC for two days, alongwith a fellow Recurser from Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;recap&#34;&gt;Recap&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2018 I did a mini batch at RC and simply loved it! I did not like staying away from my nine-month-old son for five days, though. So I decided against doing another batch for a year or two.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;ngw-2019&#34;&gt;NGW 2019&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I attended Never Graduate Week with my wife (a senior Recurser) and son and loved the experience! I began toying with the idea of coming down to RC for two days whenever possible. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have any planned project because I felt I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be doing justice to it. Also I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to lose out on the conversations and the random good things that happen in RC which don&amp;rsquo;t happen in your daily life. I was lucky to get a companion in this plan of mine (who also happens to be the father of a very young baby).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>RC Mini 5 - Day 5</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;My notes from the final day of RC Mini 5 batch&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;839-am&#34;&gt;8:39 am&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today is the last day of my batch. I plan to spend the day exploring some codebases. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend a lot of time writing code today. I might write some fun code, though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;1108-am&#34;&gt;11:08 am&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tried to read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alda-lang&#34;&gt;alda codebase&lt;/a&gt; to find out where they specify frequencies of notes. Alda was my first exposure to Clojure, and I had wanted to experiment with the frequencies of the notes to see if I could play accurate Indian classical music. I didn&amp;rsquo;t find what I was looking for. Maybe I need to learn a bit more about reading Clojure codebases before I can do such things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>RC Mini 5 - Day 4</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;My notes from the fourth day of RC Mini 5 batch&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;947-am&#34;&gt;9:47 am&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started a bit late today, and got delayed by having to skip one subway train because it was soooo crowded. I am beginning to feel that although I have completed most of my work in Clojure, I haven&amp;rsquo;t done &lt;em&gt;functional programming&lt;/em&gt; yet. I have not used any global state, and accomplished everything by calling a series of functions from other functions. I have used recursion a lot, even though Stu Halloway warns people against using it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;My notes from the third day of RC Mini 5 batch&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;819-am&#34;&gt;8:19 am&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been reading The Joy of Clojure everyday. I need to find ways to improve my Clojure code. So far I have succeeded in avoiding loops by using recursion. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to operate on lists as a whole yet, and neither have I been able to use things like the continuation-passing-style. I can&amp;rsquo;t use something &amp;lsquo;foo&amp;rsquo; unless the code stares at me in the face and says &amp;ldquo;this is the place to try out foo&amp;rdquo;. I think I need to re-read the portions of the book I read last night, and also re-read my code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;My notes from the second day of RC Mini 5 batch&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;758-am&#34;&gt;7:58 am&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been up since 6:30am. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get started with today at RC. I have been thinking about how to process a variable number of characters from a string in Clojure. I keep getting stuck because I still have the C++ while loop code in my head!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;1010-am&#34;&gt;10:10 am&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was the first person in RC today. After nearly two hours of effort I have been getting some clarity at last! I never looked at my C++ program in this way. I thought I would be able to run a simple example but then I got an error at runtime in the generated Javascript code. Need to figure that out soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;915-am&#34;&gt;9:15 am&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I woke up at my usual time of somewhere-between-6:30-and-7:00. Thanks to my son I don&amp;rsquo;t need alarms! I headed out after an hour in search of Dr Strange&amp;rsquo;s Sanctum Sanctorum. I went to 177A Bleecker St - there was no house with that address. I was helped by an â˜‚ in my search. I took a photo of the shop at 177. Now I am about to head to RC after a small breakfast. Feeling very excited for the first day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>RC Mini 5 - Day 0</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;1057-am&#34;&gt;10:57 am&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am going to the Recurse Center. Can&amp;rsquo;t believe it yet. Right now I am sitting in the bus and heading towards Boston&amp;rsquo;s South Station.&#xA;Two years ago my wife did a full batch at RC and that changed her life. It changed my life as well - I became convinced that RC was a &amp;ldquo;must-do&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;It would not have been possible for me to do a full batch unless I quit my job, so my only hope was a half batch which lasts six weeks. That was also difficult unless I managed to get six weeks of leave. Then something lucky happened - RC started a mini batch which would last only a week. And from that time I knew RC was going to happen sooner than later in my life. I applied for the first mini batch and didn&amp;rsquo;t get accepted. It was a rather good thing in hindsight. I became a father last year and the first mini batch happened when my son was a month and a half old. I would not have done that batch any way. Now my son is about to turn nine months old. It is still very difficult for me to stay apart from him - but it is not an impractical thing to do any more. Yes, my wife will have a tough time doing everything for six days. But she repeatedly assured me she can do it, and I believe her. Without a steady push from my wife I might not have applied for this batch either. I am so glad that I did apply, and got selected, and am finally going!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
