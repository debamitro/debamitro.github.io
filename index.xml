      <description>(My notes from the final day of RC Mini 5 batch)
8:39 am Today is the last day of my batch. I plan to spend the day exploring some codebases. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend a lot of time writing code today. I might write some fun code, though.
11:08 am I tried to read the alda codebase to find out where they specify frequencies of notes. Alda was my first exposure to Clojure, and I had wanted to experiment with the frequencies of the notes to see if I could play accurate Indian classical music.</description>

      <description>(My notes from the fourth day of RC Mini 5 batch)
9:47 am I started a bit late today, and got delayed by having to skip one subway train because it was soooo crowded. I am beginning to feel that although I have completed most of my work in Clojure, I haven&amp;rsquo;t done functional programming yet. I have not used any global state, and accomplished everything by calling a series of functions from other functions.</description>

      <description>(My notes from the third day of RC Mini 5 batch)
8:19 am I have been reading The Joy of Clojure everyday. I need to find ways to improve my Clojure code. So far I have succeeded in avoiding loops by using recursion. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to operate on lists as a whole yet, and neither have I been able to use things like the continuation-passing-style. I can&amp;rsquo;t use something &amp;lsquo;foo&amp;rsquo; unless the code stares at me in the face and says &amp;ldquo;this is the place to try out foo&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>(My notes from the second day of RC Mini 5 batch)
7:58 am I have been up since 6:30am. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get started with today at RC. I have been thinking about how to process a variable number of characters from a string in Clojure. I keep getting stuck because I still have the C++ while loop code in my head!
10:10 am I was the first person in RC today.</description>

      <description>9:15 am I woke up at my usual time of somewhere-between-6:30-and-7:00. Thanks to my son I don&amp;rsquo;t need alarms! I headed out after an hour in search of Dr Strange&amp;rsquo;s Sanctum Sanctorum. I went to 177A Bleecker St - there was no house with that address. I was helped by an &amp;#9730; in my search. I took a photo of the shop at 177. Now I am about to head to RC after a small breakfast.</description>

      <description>10:57 am I am going to the Recurse Center. Can&amp;rsquo;t believe it yet. Right now I am sitting in the bus and heading towards Boston&amp;rsquo;s South Station. Two years ago my wife did a full batch at RC and that changed her life. It changed my life as well - I became convinced that RC was a &amp;ldquo;must-do&amp;rdquo;. It would not have been possible for me to do a full batch unless I quit my job, so my only hope was a half batch which lasts six weeks.</description>

      <description>Does every programmer need to have projects on the side? That&amp;rsquo;s what the world wants to believe.
Here are some very tiny and simple things I have tried.
