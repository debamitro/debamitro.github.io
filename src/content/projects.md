Does every programmer need to have projects on the side? That's what the world wants to believe.

Here are some very tiny and simple things I have tried.

* [TicTacToe using reagent](http://debamitro.github.io/tictactoe-reagent-demo/)
* [Generating MIDI files using C++11](https://github.com/debamitro/generate-midi)
* [An OSX web browser which doesn't do anything](https://github.com/debamitro/stupidbrowser)

Here are some not-so-tiny things I have done.

* [Bangla transliterator from Roman letters to Unicode](https://github.com/debamitro/generate-bangla-utf8)
* [ClojureScript version of the above](http://debamitro.github.io/generate-bangla-utf8-cljs-demo/)

Here are some of my ongoing projects

* [Homesocial - an in-home social network](https://github.com/debamitro/homesocial)
* [Make-analyze - a GNU Make fork with some additional analysis features](https://github.com/debamitro/make-analyze)
