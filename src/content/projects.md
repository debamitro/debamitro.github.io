Does every programmer need to have projects on the side? That's what the world wants to believe.

Here are some very tiny and simple things I have tried.

* [TicTacToe using reagent](http://debamitro.github.io/tictactoe-reagent-demo/)
* [Generating MIDI files using C++11](https://github.com/debamitro/generate-midi)

Here are some not-so-tiny things I have done.

* [Bangla transliterator from Roman letters to Unicode](https://github.com/debamitro/generate-bangla-utf8)
* [ClojureScript version of the above](https://github.com/debamitro/generate-bangla-utf8-cljs)
