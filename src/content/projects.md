Does every programmer need to have projects on the side? That's what the world wants to believe. Although I don't understand how a professional programmer can do real side projects without affecting his/her dayjob. Or his/her sanity.

### Some tiny and simple things I have tried to do

* [TicTacToe using reagent](http://debamitro.github.io/tictactoe-reagent-demo/)
* [Generating MIDI files using C++11](https://github.com/debamitro/generate-midi)
* [An OSX web browser which doesn't do anything](https://github.com/debamitro/stupidbrowser)
* [A very minimal JavaScript library for printing a collapsible tree](https://github.com/debamitro/minimalist-tree-js)

### Some not-so-tiny things I have done

* [Bangla transliterator from Roman letters to Unicode](https://github.com/debamitro/generate-bangla-utf8)
* [ClojureScript version of the above](http://debamitro.github.io/generate-bangla-utf8-cljs-demo/)
* [A search engine for recent YouTube videos](https://yt-recent-popular.herokuapp.com) ([source](https://github.com/debamitro/yt-recent-popular))

### Here are some of my ongoing projects

* [Homesocial - an in-home social network](https://github.com/debamitro/homesocial)
* [Make-analyze - a GNU Make fork with some additional analysis features](https://github.com/debamitro/make-analyze)
