I had been thinking of writing a completely different blog post, but just a while ago I got sidetracked by [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai)'s [post on vibe coding at a hackathon](https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/vibe-coding-menugen/). It is a great time to be alive when LLMs are changing technology forever, and one of the most famous researchers in AI is trying it out like the rest of us developers.

## My vibe coding experience

Even before the term was [invented in a tweet](https://blog.codepromptfu.com/posts/what-are-ai-prompts-for-coding/) I had almost stopped writing code by hand. I let LLMs write at least 90% of any code I commit, and use LLM advice for the writing the rest. Here is a graphical representation of all the vibe coding I did in the last few months (thanks to [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com)).

In the last few months I have vibe coded and launched some small websites, like

* [A stackoverflow for coding prompts](https://codepromptfu.com)
* [A gift searching site](https://www.kidsbdaygifts.com)
* [A browser-based game for kids](http://doodle-game-2d.vercel.app/)
* [A Totoro comic maker](http://totoro-comics.vercel.app/) (I did this before OpenAI created the 'Ghibli storm')

I have also been working on a full-stack web app for a startup, among other things.

## What is delightful about vibe coding

### The beginning

Some people cannot start writing on an empty page. I think I am one of them. Vibe coding gives you a huge headstart - at least for web apps and websites. If you use small, concise prompts for each step of your project, you will almost always get working code.

### Getting unstuck

Of course every project runs into issues. Every day. I have found that LLMs are better at debugging than you alone. At least you don't need to wade through half of the internet to find the best answer for you.

### API integration

Nothing on the web can be done reliably without using third-party APIs. The leading vibe coding environments do a decent job on this front as well. Choosing the right API also used to be a challenge. Again, LLM-based tools like [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai) and [Claude](https://www.claude.ai) save you time and keep you moving faster.

### Coming up with new approaches

Many times I have been pleasantly surprised by the way LLMs generate code for a task. Specially when it is not what I thought, but something better. Yes, this has happened many times with me. Which is why I often ask the LLM to write some code even though I also know one way of doing it. I guess there are always multiple ways of programming to solve the same problem. It is also probably because I am not a great programmer - most of my initial ideas are sub-optimal.

## What needs to get better

### Framework version changes

Sometimes the AI tools are not able to keep up with changes in software frameworks. I think this problem should go away when the vibe coding tools become more agentic.

### UI improvements

The only tool which I have been seen create decent UIs is [v0](https://v0.dev). There must be others too. But I am not happy with the kind of UI created by vibe coding IDEs today. Given that the basic purpose of all apps is to help humans, better UIs are a necessity. Humans judge by looks far too much.

### Rust support

I have recently started trying to vibe code in Rust, and that has been quite rocky. I am waiting for this to improve, because I believe Rust is a far easier language for machines to understand. Unless that is exactly why it is not the best thing for LLMs, which are more human than traditional computer algorithms.

## What next

I am waiting for this novelty around vibe coding to wear off. When this becomes the 'new normal' and we don't even notice it, we no longer might have to sit at a desk and do programming. Maybe we'll be on a call with an AI agent who is doing the job, while we get to do better things in life.
