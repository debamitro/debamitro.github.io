I was thinking about creating social networks for specific purposes, when one day I figured out it would be good to have a social network restricted to my home. I got this idea looking at my son and thinking what he would do on Facebook a few years from now. I have nothing against Facebook or any social network - I think they are all fabulous. I just think that an internet-based social network is like the world outside your home. You are not ready for it when you are very young.

So I got started, when I was at StrangeLoop this year. I don't know much web development, and tried to learn and do something simple. The result is [homesocial](https://github.com/debamitro/homesocial). It is still very very bare bones. All you can do with it is create a social network server and then access it from the same machine. After that you can login as any user and post anything. Your 'wall' shows everyone's posts. Yes, you read correctly - there is no password for any user. It is all based on trust. After all, you trust everyone at home, right?

I need to implement a lot of things like

* Ability to post images
* Ability to post links to the internet
* Ability to post in any language
* Ability to post using emojis

I also need to make the browser-based client look attractive, after I have fixed all the bugs. Maybe I'll never get there - who knows! I guess this can be easily done using some existing project. I didn't care, I just wanted to write my own thing. For my son when he grows up.
