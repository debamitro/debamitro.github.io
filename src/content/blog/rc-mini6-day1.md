Yesterday was the first day of my second mini batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com). This time I am attending a remote batch, which in itself is a new experience. I had the time to think and [plan my time for this batch]({{< ref "planning-for-rc-mini6-2020.md" >}}), since I didn't have arrange transport or accommodation. I don't know how much of the plan I am following, but I guess I am not too much off track.

## Interaction with Recursers

I think I am doing good on this front, at least by my standards. I chatted for a while with my onboarding buddy, and she gave me a nice suggestion about podcasting instead of blogging. Perhaps I'll do that some day!

I also attended a Front-end developer setup session which was very beginner-friendly. I had never heard of [Surge](https://surge.sh) before.

## Work

I got started with [homesocial](https://github.com/debamitro/homesocial), which I hadn't touched in months. I was able to use it, and also understand the code I had written last year. I guess writing less code has its advantages. I got it to work from different laptops on the same WiFi network. I did this in a round-about way, which I now realize. I'll simplify it today.

I think this will be my primary activity this week. One challenge is that I really don't have a list of things to do in this project. But it is very basic, so I am adding features as I go along, as long as the end product becomes something that my son can use one day (!)

### Tidbits

Some smaller things I did were

* I tried to build [a Rust project](https://github.com/fabianschuiki/moore) but ran into errors, so I abandoned it for now
* I did a little bit of work on an Indian Classical music catalogue website, which I might use as a demo some day

## Overall feeling

I think I was at least four times more charged up and energetic when I did a batch in person. Right now I am taking it too easy. I guess this is unavoidable, given the remote nature of things.

I should mention that one aspect of remote RC makes me very happy - being able to go to bed with my family at the end of the day. This is something I miss when I go away and do something. It is possible that this comfort is bringing my intensity down. Let's see how the week goes.
