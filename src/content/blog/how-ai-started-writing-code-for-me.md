I just realized that I haven't blogged in four years, so it will be a while before my blog catches up with me. I feel like I am a different person now... Okay, I'll get to the topic I was excited to write about.

### First look

The first time I saw AI-assisted software development was a demo of a project called [all hands](https://www.all-hands.dev) . I was amazed that LLMs (large language models) could read bug reports from screenshots, fix and test code, and then deploy the changes too. It looked so voodoo to me. Soon I found out that this was becoming commonplace with most of the popular LLMs.

### Enter SunDAI, and more

Then I happened to find out about the [SunDAI club](https://www.sundai.club) which builds and launches web apps using AI tools, almost every Sunday. This coincided with my resignation from my job - I was planning to take a career break in order to start my own company. I put myself on the club's waitlist, and after a couple of months I was invited.

Meanwhile I had quit my job and had started playing with [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com), the leading AI code editor. I liked it. Before I used it a lot, I heard about [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf) from the SunDAI folks and gave it a shot. The experience was so good I never stopped using it. In fact, I am typing this blog in Windsurf now. I even made changes to the blog's appearance using it.

### Four weeks of AI-assisted coding

In the last four weeks, I have

* fixed the appearance of one of my websites on mobile screens
* developed three nextjs apps without any experience with React or nextjs
* wrote a python web app for classifying my Gmail messages
* tried out in-browser 2-d and 3-d game development
* experimented with multiple AI models available on [replicate](https://www.replicate.com)

I have only used AI for coding - okay maybe 99.9% of the time. There were times when I had to correct the code manually. But it was rare. Most of the times, AI can write fresh code, understand existing code, try out code changes, iterate over different approaches. 

### The future of programming

In short, an AI coding agent is like a junior or mid-level engineer you have employed. I know it sounds futuristic and maybe foolish. But I have two decades of software engineering experience and today I believe nobody should be required to write code by hand. Just like compilers and high-level programming languages removed the need for writing machine code using a processor's native instruction set.

Mind you, programming languages will be there and will continue to evolve. We just invented a higher-level abstraction, called an AI prompt. The history of programming languages is full of examples of a higher-level abstraction helping us 'move up the ladder'. I think most of the software engineers tomorrow will become prompt engineers.
