Today is the last day of my batch - that's how fast a Mini batch flies by. Let me recap what happened in the last two days

## Interaction with Recursers

I had another great coffee chat where we talked about things like the [birdsong recognition contest at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/birdsong-recognition) and how remote participation in RC can be more fun. I also got good questions about security in my [homesocial](https://github.com/debamitro/homesocial) project, which I hadn't thought of before.

## Project work

I added profile pages to [homesocial](https://github.com/debamitro/homesocial), although they are pretty basic now - with only a name and a description. I also added login buttons for everyone who has a profile. The earlier way of logging in with any name still works.

After this was done I spent most of my time making slides and a demo for a presentation on it. Making the demo was real fun, because it involved a hypothetical conversation among a baby and his parents over the in-home social network.

### Reflection on project work

What I liked the most about my project work in my batch is that I was building an entire system end-to-end, and on top of that I was deciding what to implement. The technical challenges were not huge, but the autonomy I got made me very happy.

## Other stuff

I browsed through [moore](https://github.com/fabianschuiki/moore) in Visual Studio Code, after installing rust-analyzer. I must say I am pretty much blown away by VSCode. After emacs this is the first time I encountered a development environment which had so much useful stuff bundled by default. Not only does VSCode have suitable features for every language, it is quite fast - even on my 2012 MacBook Pro.

I also discovered that [the creator of Tcl](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/home.php) was also the co-founder of Electric Cloud, and part of the team which implemented Raft. Having used Tcl and Electric Accelerator, and having heard enough about Raft from people interested in distributed programming - I was surprised to find the same person behind all of these.

## The end, for now

I looked at my [plan for this batch]({{< ref "planning-for-rc-mini6-2020.md" >}}) and realized that I didn't do most of the things I planned. But I think I did the important ones. 
All in all I had a lovely week and met some really nice people. I'll end this batch saying
