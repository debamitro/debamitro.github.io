(*My notes from the second day of RC Mini 5 batch*)

### 7:58 am
I have been up since 6:30am. Can't wait to get started with today at RC. I have been thinking about how to process a variable number of characters from a string in Clojure. I keep getting stuck because I still have the C++ while loop code in my head!

### 10:10 am
I was the first person in RC today. After nearly two hours of effort I have been getting some clarity at last! I never looked at my C++ program in this way. I thought I would be able to run a simple example but then I got an error at runtime in the generated Javascript code. Need to figure that out soon.

### 1:56 pm
I just learned a useful bit of Perl from someone here. I could never figure out a way of splitting my Perl code into modules and use them without keeping them in the current working directory. What I learned was one line of Perl which allows me to use a module from any given path. I found it documented at https://perldoc.perl.org/lib.html later on.

### 2:02 pm
Yes, I got the first bit of vowel-conversion working, somehow. "Aiu" does get converted to "আইউ" although it doesn't mean anything.

### 5:01 pm
After some more mind-bending Clojure-ing, I have got "kAku" -> "কাকু" working! I have a strong feeling that I have reached here in a rather roundabout manner.

### 5:15 pm
Figured out an unoptimized way of adding an RSS feed to my blog which is currently part of my Hugo website. I needed to do this in order to add the blog to RC's blog aggregator.

### 5:30 pm
Oh no, Chrome is hanging! I hate when this happens. I have a secret hope of fixing all such problems the day I join the Chrome engineering team - just joking!

### 9:00 pm
I have been finally able to get "DisTrikT" -> "ডিস্ট্রিক্ট" working. I needed to think a lot and also consult Stu Halloway's book a number of times. I hope to simplify my Clojure code vastly some day in the future.
