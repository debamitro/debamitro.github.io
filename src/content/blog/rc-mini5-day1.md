### 9:15 am
I woke up at my usual time of somewhere-between-6:30-and-7:00. Thanks to my son I don't need alarms! I headed out after an hour in search of Dr Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum. I went to 177A Bleecker St - there was no house with that address. I was helped by an &#9730; in my search. I took a photo of the shop at 177. Now I am about to head to RC after a small breakfast. Feeling very excited for the first day.

### 2:02 pm
I am finally sitting down to start my planned project. I have also got Stu Halloway's 'Programming Clojure' with me. I am overly well-fed - I ate chicken over rice from Soho's best Halal Cart. It is a dish worth dying for.

### 4:39 pm
I have been able to create a small starter ClojureScript project which can attach a handler to the click event of a button. It was surprisingly hard to do even though I knew how to accomplish the same thing in pure Javascript and HTML. Thanks to all the people who have created resources like [The ClojureScript Cheatsheet](http://cljs.info/cheatsheet/) and http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/ and the Clojure/ClojureScript websites. You all are so very helpful. I wish there were useful resources like this for other stuff in life, and in offices.

### 5:20 pm
I could actually print one UTF-8 encoded Bangla character to an HTML document using my app written so far. I have pushed the code to my new github repo https://github.com/debamitro/generate-bangla-utf8-cljs

### 6:48 pm
I have started writing the core of my application - the actual part which will convert Bangla transliterated using English to Unicode UTF-8. I took a small walk, and also consulted three books on Clojure - Programming Clojure, The Joy of Clojure and Clojure for the Brave and True. I think I am going to stick with the same namespace prefix for my code.

### 10:17 pm
I might try to get a little bit of my application working. When I left RC I had it in a state where I could transliterate a few consonants.

### 10:35 pm
I think I am waaaay too tired &#128564;.
