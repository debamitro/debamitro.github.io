(*My notes from the final day of RC Mini 5 batch*)

### 8:39 am
Today is the last day of my batch. I plan to spend the day exploring some codebases. I don't want to spend a lot of time writing code today. I might write some fun code, though.

### 11:08 am
I tried to read the [alda codebase](https://github.com/alda-lang) to find out where they specify frequencies of notes. Alda was my first exposure to Clojure, and I had wanted to experiment with the frequencies of the notes to see if I could play accurate Indian classical music. I didn't find what I was looking for. Maybe I need to learn a bit more about reading Clojure codebases before I can do such things.

I started to port the first Three.js example from the book 'Learning Three.js' from JavaScript to ClojureScript. This is some fun code which is not going to be helpful today. It might help me use three.js in future or it might keep my Clojure skills sharp.

### 11:48 am
The first example is done! The code can be improved, but I feel the ClojureScript version is already a bit easier to comprehend than the JavaScript version. I have pushed it to https://github.com/debamitro/learning-threejs-examples-cljs.

### 3:50 pm
I had to leave RC early today because of my son's fever. I will be boarding the bus to Boston in a while. Since I had to make a premature exit I didn't get time to say byes to everybody. It would have been hard to do that anyway. Even though I spent a lot of time wrestling with my code I had a lot of very nice chats with a lot of people. Something in me tells me this was a teaser of RC for me. I'll be back for a longer batch some day.
