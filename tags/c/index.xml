      <description>Today I saw I had made the same mistake twice in a month. It is a rather harmless-looking mistake in C.&#xA;I first saw it in 2006, barely a year after I started working as a software engineer. Someone was having a crash only with a 64-bit build. Two people were looking into it and I somehow got involved. A function was returning a pointer to a structure and dereferencing this pointer was causing a crash.</description>
