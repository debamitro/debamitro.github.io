      <description>(This is a continuation from my previous blog post.)&#xA;Re-cap I was trying to read in audio samples from my microphone using Rust&amp;rsquo;s cpal library. Somehow I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get 44100 samples per second even though I had verified that the sampling rate was 44100 Hz. I tried various things and nothing seemed to work.&#xA;More attempts to solve the mystery Attempt 4 Cpal uses coreaudio-rs on OSX, which is a &amp;ldquo;Rust-esque&amp;rdquo; interface over Apple&amp;rsquo;s CoreAudio framework.</description>

      <description>It all started in the third week of my batch at the Recurse Center, when I got interested in Audio Signal Processing, and signed up for a Coursera course which some people were doing. My biggest goal for the batch was to get better at using Rust. So, I thought I should do the assignments in the course using Rust. Looking for a basic audio library, I found cpal.&#xA;Playing with cpal A couple of years ago I had played briefly with portaudio, which is a very widely-used C library for audio applications.</description>

      <description>I spent most of my working hours in the last six weeks learning about and using the Rust programming language. Here is an account of that. No, I am still nothing more than a beginner in Rust.&#xA;The opportunity I could spend this time in this fashion by being in a remote batch at the Recurse Center (also known as RC). I learnt a lot by myself, but only because I had the opportunity to chat and pair with other programmers.</description>
