      <description>After a couple of months of coding using AI prompts, I found two cases where a particular prompt doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. Maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll start working sometime soon. Or, it is possible that they work with a different AI coding tool or LLM other than the ones I tried.&#xA;Case I I have started to use Clerk for user authentication. It is really easy to use, but I have bumped into one small problem everytime I asked Windsurf to add Clerk authentication in a project.</description>

      <description>Quick intro Here&amp;rsquo;s an idea that ocurred to me almost a month ago, and something that I have been working on since then. As I have written in an earlier post, I started using AI for programming and haven&amp;rsquo;t stopped doing that yet. Which means, I am chatting with a tool in English, and the tool is doing everything that constitutes programming&#xA;Writing some code Fixing errors Improving the code Understanding code - this is very useful for things which I don&amp;rsquo;t always have in my short-term memory (think CSS, JavaScript framework quirks etc) Trying out new approaches Debugging deployment and production issues The list above is real - I have actually done all of them and more.</description>
