      <description>Inspired by Harper Reed&amp;rsquo;s blog post I want to document the way I am using AI. Specifically, large language models or LLMs.&#xA;What I do I have to confess this first. I am unemployed at the moment, on a planned career break. So, I have all the time in the world to use any AI tool I want. I can afford to devote additional time to get familiar with any LLM-based tool.</description>

      <description>After a couple of months of coding using AI prompts, I found two cases where a particular prompt doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. Maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll start working sometime soon. Or, it is possible that they work with a different AI coding tool or LLM other than the ones I tried.&#xA;Case I I have started to use Clerk for user authentication. It is really easy to use, but I have bumped into one small problem everytime I asked Windsurf to add Clerk authentication in a project.</description>

      <description>Quick intro Here&amp;rsquo;s an idea that ocurred to me almost a month ago, and something that I have been working on since then. As I have written in an earlier post, I started using AI for programming and haven&amp;rsquo;t stopped doing that yet. Which means, I am chatting with a tool in English, and the tool is doing everything that constitutes programming&#xA;Writing some code Fixing errors Improving the code Understanding code - this is very useful for things which I don&amp;rsquo;t always have in my short-term memory (think CSS, JavaScript framework quirks etc) Trying out new approaches Debugging deployment and production issues The list above is real - I have actually done all of them and more.</description>

      <title>How AI Started Writing Code for Me</title>

      <description>I just realized that I haven&amp;rsquo;t blogged in four years, so it will be a while before my blog catches up with me. I feel like I am a different person now&amp;hellip; Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ll get to the topic I was excited to write about.&#xA;First look The first time I saw AI-assisted software development was a demo of a project called all hands . I was amazed that LLMs (large language models) could read bug reports from screenshots, fix and test code, and then deploy the changes too.</description>
