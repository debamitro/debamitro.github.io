      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just realized that I have been working from home for fifteen months now. Yes, this is due to the Covid-19 pandemic and most people around the world are doing the same thing.  But I never thought I would do this. Or, get to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;did-i-ever-love-going-to-office&#34;&gt;Did I ever love going to office?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I first started working I used to think that office time was highly overrated. I wanted flexibility to work from anywhere and envied the people who got that. I never did. Yes, over the years my employers became less interested in the hours I spent in office. But I never saw someone&amp;rsquo;s career go well if they stopped showing up. So I forced myself to show up. I usually did that at my own sweet time. Luckily most of my employers have had fluid working hours.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
