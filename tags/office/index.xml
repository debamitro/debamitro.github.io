      <description>I just realized that I have been working from home for fifteen months now. Yes, this is due to the Covid-19 pandemic and most people around the world are doing the same thing. But I never thought I would do this. Or, get to do this.&#xA;Did I ever love going to office? When I first started working I used to think that office time was highly overrated. I wanted flexibility to work from anywhere and envied the people who got that.</description>
