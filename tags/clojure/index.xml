      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had read wonderful things about Clojure many years ago in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://swaroopch.com/2013/08/24/ghoseb-clojure-course-day-1/&#34;&gt;blog post series&lt;/a&gt;. At that time it seemed very different from the type of programming I used to do at my day job. I had no idea that it could be used for creating any of the software programs I used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;strangeloop-and-alda&#34;&gt;StrangeLoop and Alda&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I attended &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thestrangeloop.com&#34;&gt;StrangeLoop&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in 2017 - and my mind was blown. I somehow picked up an intention to explore functional programming languages. This had never happened to me before. I mean, I was curious about functional programming, and had listened to lectures available on youtube, including some chapters of SICP. But nothing ever felt like something I was capable of trying out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
