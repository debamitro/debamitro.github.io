      <description>&lt;p&gt;My last working day at my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cadence.com&#34;&gt;previous employer&lt;/a&gt; was December 13 2024. Tomorrow I complete one year of my journey towards becoming an entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;re-cap---why-i-quit&#34;&gt;Re-cap - why I quit&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was not laid off. And it was not going bad for me at my job. In fact, I was at the highest point of my career in chip design software. I quit my job because I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wanted to be an entrepreneur. And I realized that, unlike a lot of successful entrepreneurs, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; am incapable of starting it on the side. I also had the advantage of having a high-earning spouse, and I felt that it was a signal from above. The entire universe was pushing me towards the next thing in life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
