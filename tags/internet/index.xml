      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/ThePrimeagen/status/2009628174280474757?s=20&#34;&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt; reminded me of my encounters with software code coverage. For a number of years in my professional career, I was required to do something or the other for improving software code coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;definition&#34;&gt;Definition&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Software code coverage is a metric which is defined as the percentage of source code lines executed by the test cases supplied with it. There is a school of thought that this metric should be as close to 100% as possible.&#xA;In other words, if the software runs on all the test cases supplied with it, almost every single line of source code should get executed. I don&amp;rsquo;t need to explain this further, because there is ample literature on the internet about this. And I am no expert on it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
