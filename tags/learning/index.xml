      <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;https://harper.blog/2025/02/16/my-llm-codegen-workflow-atm/&#34;&gt;Harper Reed&amp;rsquo;s blog post&lt;/a&gt; I want to document the way I am using AI. Specifically, large language models or LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-do&#34;&gt;What I do&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have to confess this first. I am unemployed at the moment, on a planned career break.&#xA;So, I have all the time in the world to use any AI tool I want. I can afford to devote additional time&#xA;to get familiar with any LLM-based tool. And I am very privileged to be located only 15 miles away from Cambridge, Massachusetts - which is one of the biggest AI hubs in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I Got Into Clojure</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had read wonderful things about Clojure many years ago in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://swaroopch.com/2013/08/24/ghoseb-clojure-course-day-1/&#34;&gt;blog post series&lt;/a&gt;. At that time it seemed very different from the type of programming I used to do at my day job. I had no idea that it could be used for creating any of the software programs I used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;strangeloop-and-alda&#34;&gt;StrangeLoop and Alda&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I attended &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thestrangeloop.com&#34;&gt;StrangeLoop&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in 2017 - and my mind was blown. I somehow picked up an intention to explore functional programming languages. This had never happened to me before. I mean, I was curious about functional programming, and had listened to lectures available on youtube, including some chapters of SICP. But nothing ever felt like something I was capable of trying out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
