      <description>Background More than a year ago, I was looking for a project which would help me learn the Rust programming language. I like creating small projects from scratch, so I thought of solving a problem I had encountered occasionally at work. C (and C++ as well) doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a standard way of accessing its data structures programmatically. Some languages have type introspection capabilities, and C/C++ obviously don&amp;rsquo;t have that either. As a result, we often need to implement boilerplate utility code for dealing with C/C++ structures.</description>
