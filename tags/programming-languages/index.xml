      <description>I spent most of my working hours in the last six weeks learning about and using the Rust programming language. Here is an account of that. No, I am still nothing more than a beginner in Rust.&#xA;The opportunity I could spend this time in this fashion by being in a remote batch at the Recurse Center (also known as RC). I learnt a lot by myself, but only because I had the opportunity to chat and pair with other programmers.</description>

      <description>Learning a new programming language is always a nice way to kick your brain into action. I first experienced this when I tried to learn Lisp by watching some video lectures. It took me months to digest the concepts and I never got around to writing any lisp. But the ideas stayed with me for years. Later on I did learn Clojure and spend some months writing a bit of Clojure and ClojureScript.</description>
