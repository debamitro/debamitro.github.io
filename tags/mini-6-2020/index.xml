      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is the last day of my batch - that&amp;rsquo;s how fast a Mini batch flies by. Let me recap what happened in the last two days&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;interaction-with-recursers&#34;&gt;Interaction with Recursers&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had another great coffee chat where we talked about things like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/c/birdsong-recognition&#34;&gt;birdsong recognition contest at Kaggle&lt;/a&gt; and how remote participation in RC can be more fun. I also got good questions about security in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/debamitro/homesocial&#34;&gt;homesocial&lt;/a&gt; project, which I hadn&amp;rsquo;t thought of before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So now I am at the end of day 3 of this batch - which means more than half is over! A lot has happened that I want to write about, although I have made very little progress on the side projects I planned to work on. Like the previous post, I am organizing this one by theme.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;interaction-with-recursers&#34;&gt;Interaction with Recursers&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is going really well - again, by my own standards. Yesterday I had a nice long chat with a fellow Recurser on build systems, C++ and PHP in the modern era. I also attended a group music listening session late in the night, and it was very therapeutic for me. As I realize time and again - music has a profound effect on my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was the first day of my second mini batch at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.recurse.com&#34;&gt;Recurse Center&lt;/a&gt;. This time I am attending a remote batch, which in itself is a new experience. I had the time to think and &lt;a href=&#34;https://debamitro.github.io/blog/planning-for-rc-mini6-2020/&#34;&gt;plan my time for this batch&lt;/a&gt;, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have arrange transport or accommodation. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how much of the plan I am following, but I guess I am not too much off track.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;interaction-with-recursers&#34;&gt;Interaction with Recursers&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think I am doing good on this front, at least by my standards. I chatted for a while with my onboarding buddy, and she gave me a nice suggestion about podcasting instead of blogging. Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll do that some day!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
