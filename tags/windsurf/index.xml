      <description>After a couple of months of coding using AI prompts, I found two cases where a particular prompt doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. Maybe they&amp;rsquo;ll start working sometime soon. Or, it is possible that they work with a different AI coding tool or LLM other than the ones I tried.&#xA;Case I I have started to use Clerk for user authentication. It is really easy to use, but I have bumped into one small problem everytime I asked Windsurf to add Clerk authentication in a project.</description>

      <description>I just realized that I haven&amp;rsquo;t blogged in four years, so it will be a while before my blog catches up with me. I feel like I am a different person now&amp;hellip; Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ll get to the topic I was excited to write about.&#xA;First look The first time I saw AI-assisted software development was a demo of a project called all hands . I was amazed that LLMs (large language models) could read bug reports from screenshots, fix and test code, and then deploy the changes too.</description>
