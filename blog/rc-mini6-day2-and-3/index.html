        <p>So now I am at the end of day 3 of this batch - which means more than half is over! A lot has happened that I want to write about, although I have made very little progress on the side projects I planned to work on. Like the previous post, I am organizing this one by theme.</p>
<h2 id="interaction-with-recursers">Interaction with Recursers</h2>
<p>This is going really well - again, by my own standards. Yesterday I had a nice long chat with a fellow Recurser on build systems, C++ and PHP in the modern era. I also attended a group music listening session late in the night, and it was very therapeutic for me. As I realize time and again - music has a profound effect on my life.</p>
<h2 id="_the_-project"><em>The</em> project</h2>
<p>The project I am working on is <a href="https://github.com/debamitro/homesocial">homesocial</a>, as I mentioned before. I started this nearly a year ago and hadn&rsquo;t touched it beyond an initial proof-of-concept.</p>
<p>I spent Tuesday (day 2) simplifying the way the browser-based client finds the server. Instead of making the user specify the server&rsquo;s IP address during logging in, I used the URL from the request made to the client.</p>
<p>Today I added a timestamp to each post, and sorted the feed based on them. This took some time, because I was sending an integer from the client, and the server was finally writing a floating point number to the database. I finally found out that JavaScript&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/now">Date.now()</a> method returns a value in <em>milliseconds</em> which was going beyond 64 bits. Sqlite <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#type_affinity">stores an integer as a floating point number if it cannot fit into 64 bits</a>. The simple solution was to send this to the database</p>

</code></pre></div><h2 id="other-work">Other work</h2>
<h3 id="building-that-rust-project">Building that Rust project</h3>
<p>I finally succeeded in building <a href="https://github.com/fabianschuiki/moore">this Rust project</a>. The errors were due to a git submodule whose files weren&rsquo;t copied to my local repo. I didn&rsquo;t even know that something called a submodule existed - thankfuly the Git book <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">explained pretty well</a>.</p>
<h3 id="pushing-out-a-project-to-heroku">Pushing out a project to Heroku</h3>
<p>I had been building a demo of a website for <em>browsing</em> (not searching) Indian Classical music recordings on YouTube. While this is far from complete, I needed to make it visible since I wanted to demo it to a few people. It took me a while to figure out Heroku&rsquo;s use of the PORT environment variable, but after that it was quite easy to push.</p>
<h3 id="trying-to-extract-weather-data">Trying to extract weather data</h3>
<p>I got started on this idea which I had long ago, about organizing weather data by temperature and not by location. I am trying to see if the <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/">NOAA&rsquo;s</a> CSV files can help me. They seem to be the best free option available.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-am-feeling">How I am feeling</h2>
<p>For a large part of these two days I felt a bit guilty about enjoying my time in the batch like a vacation instead of treating it like a sprint. I think I managed to get over these feelings and start pushing myself. Some counseling from my wife definitely helped, and so did two hours of music last night!</p>
