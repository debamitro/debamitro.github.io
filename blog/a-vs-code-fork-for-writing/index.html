        <h2 id="the-seed">The seed</h2>
<p>It was my friend <a href="https://x.com/FridoHaugg">Frido</a> who planted the seeds of this idea into my brain, by showing me a <a href="https://www.cladlabs.ai">&lsquo;brainrot IDE&rsquo;</a> which had been accepted into YCombinator&rsquo;s Fall 2025 batch. I tried it out and discovered that, like many other AI-enabled IDEs, it was a forked version of Visual Studio Code a.k.a. VS Code. The only difference was that it was an indirect fork. Its &lsquo;parent&rsquo; source code came from an open-source AI-enabled IDE called <a href="https://voideditor.com">Void</a>. VS Code was technically the &lsquo;grandpa&rsquo;.</p>
<h2 id="using-void">Using Void</h2>
<p>Thanks to the brainrot IDE I got interested in Void, and started using it. I made some minor local modifications to the source code and built it locally. It was a great feeling. I hadn&rsquo;t turned my coding experience upside down, but I had successfully tweaked the source code of my IDE. Long ago I was a vim user, and then for many years I was an emacs user. Somehow I never ended up modifying the source code of either tool. Maybe I didn&rsquo;t need to - after all vim and emacs are both amazing tools out of the box. But today, here I was, rebuilding my own IDE. And using what I built.</p>
<h2 id="my-own-vs-code-fork">My own VS Code fork</h2>
<p>I could already feel a thread starting in my mind &lsquo;what if I created my own VS Code fork&rsquo;. I considered some ideas, and the one which stuck to my mind was a &lsquo;Cursor for writers&rsquo;.</p>
<h2 id="sundai-week-96">SundAI week 96</h2>
<p>I prototyped the idea of &lsquo;Cursor for writers&rsquo; on a <a href="https://sundai.club">SundAI</a> hack day. All I managed to do was add a new button to my locally modified version of Void. Clicking that button would generate the structure of an empty book in the current workspace. I used LLMs to fill up the contents of the book, and then used a VS Code extension called <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=abechanta.vscode-ext-paged-media">&lsquo;Markdown Paged Media&rsquo;</a> to convert every page to a pdf. I got convinced that more could be done. I decided to turn this into a project called <a href="https://github.com/debamitro/asimov">Asimov</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-real-work-begins">The real work begins</h2>
<p>Creating the fork from Void was easy enough. Adding the functionality I had in mind was not. Claude Code got me started, but I felt a little uneasy proceeding without knowing how the VS Code source code was organized. So I did a lot of research using GPT-5 and Claude on how to proceed. I learned the architecture behind VSCode and how such a big desktop app was written purely in TypeScript. I should admit that GPT-5 has become quite good. It is also convenient to use it from Github Copilot because it can see a Github repository.</p>
<p>After a couple of days&rsquo; effort, I could add a menu option which saved the book from markdown source to final pdf. I still have much more to do before this is usable. Right now I am integrating <a href="https://pagedjs.org">pagedjs</a> into the generated book.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-ides">The future of IDEs</h2>
<p>The reason I am writing this blog post is that I had never imagined creating a customized version of an IDE all by myself. This is only possible because of AI-assisted coding. And of course, because of the excellent base version provided by Microsoft (and subsequently, Void).</p>
<p>What could this mean for the future? Maybe we&rsquo;ll see many more locally customized versions of VS Code in small and medium-sized businesses. Instead of learning how to use a general tool for handling proprietary knowledge, we could have just the right tool for a specific problem. Earlier this was unaffordable for anyone other than large tech companies. That is no longer the case.</p>
