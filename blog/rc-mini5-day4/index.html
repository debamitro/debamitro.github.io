<p>(<em>My notes from the fourth day of RC Mini 5 batch</em>)</p>

<h3 id="9-47-am">9:47 am</h3>

<p>I started a bit late today, and got delayed by having to skip one subway train because it was soooo crowded. I am beginning to feel that although I have completed most of my work in Clojure, I haven&rsquo;t done <em>functional programming</em> yet. I have not used any global state, and accomplished everything by calling a series of functions from other functions. I have used recursion a lot, even though Stu Halloway warns people against using it.</p>

<h3 id="11-04-am">11:04 am</h3>

<p>Finally I have my unit testing system ready. The way to get here was to have my core code in a .cljc file so that both the Clojure test and the ClojureScript app can see it.</p>

<h3 id="12-07-pm">12:07 pm</h3>

<p>I have started using Atom for Clojure. I was using it for writing my blog posts since yesterday. I moved to it for code because my unit tests have Unicode characters and emacs doesn&rsquo;t show them well in terminal mode. Let&rsquo;s see how long I can use Atom - haven&rsquo;t switched to a new editing environment in years!</p>

<h3 id="2-54-pm">2:54 pm</h3>

<p>Had a really nice post-lunch conversation about JavaScript virtual machines and other stuff. On the Atom front, I haven&rsquo;t given up yet. The fonts and editing experience are really nice. I was suspecting I would miss my emacs shortcuts but I haven&rsquo;t. I guess the reason may be most of my shortcuts are specific to C/C++ development. This might be a nice lesson for future me: when learning a new programming language try to use a new editor for that.</p>

<h3 id="4-43-pm">4:43 pm</h3>

<p>Paired with someone here and learned how to use the &ldquo;thread-first macro&rdquo; operator in Clojure. It seems to be a neat way to write a series of function calls which need to happen in a pipeline-like manner. Previously I was calling  functions from other functions. So in order to ensure that function1 happened before function2, I would do (or think about doing) either of the following:
* call function2 with a call to function1 as the argument
* write function2 as an anonymous function which calls function1
* pass function2 as an argument to function1 and call it from inside</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/threading_macros#thread-first">-&gt; operator</a> code is sooo much more readable now!</p>

<h3 id="11-02-pm">11:02 pm</h3>

<p>The evening went by in presentations followed by a lot of conversations with different people. I need to find a way to cope with reality after RC, specially from next week!</p>
