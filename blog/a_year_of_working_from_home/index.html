        <p>I just realized that I have been working from home for fifteen months now. Yes, this is due to the Covid-19 pandemic and most people around the world are doing the same thing.  But I never thought I would do this. Or, get to do this.</p>
<h2 id="did-i-ever-love-going-to-office">Did I ever love going to office?</h2>
<p>When I first started working I used to think that office time was highly overrated. I wanted flexibility to work from anywhere and envied the people who got that. I never did. Yes, over the years my employers became less interested in the hours I spent in office. But I never saw someone&rsquo;s career go well if they stopped showing up. So I forced myself to show up. I usually did that at my own sweet time. Luckily most of my employers have had fluid working hours.</p>
<h2 id="working-from-a-cafe">Working from a cafe</h2>
<p>I used to <em>love</em> the idea of working from cafes. Some years ago I got a chance to do this when I was in New York City to visit my wife (who was doing a batch at the Recurse Center). I got my coffee and my MacBook and kept it open waiting for magic to happen. I never got any single thing done the few hours I tried it. It seemed to me the people who worked at cafes had some special abilities which I lacked. Probably I was too excited by my surroundings to actually <em>do</em> anything.</p>
<h2 id="march-2020">March 2020</h2>
<p>So I realized I did function best inside an office, despite my mixed feelings towards that. I continued to show up every day at office whether I worked there or not. Then came March 2020 - the month when everybody had to pack up and go home. I was very happy and super productive for &hellip; just about three days. My back and my hand hurt. I never needed any ergonomic equipment at home so I had none. I had to buy a good mouse and an ergonomic keyboard, followed by a monitor and a desk. It seemed working from home was expensive!</p>
<h2 id="ups-and-downs-and-ups-and-downs">Ups and downs and ups and downs</h2>
<p>The best summary of the last fifteen months would be - they were like a slow roller coaster. I kept having good times and bad times. I hit one problem, then got out of it, and then hit the next problem. Or an old problem again. I think I am much wiser, having gone through this experience. I never knew spending all day with my own mind would be so difficult. I never knew I could feel so demotivated for so long. I had almost forgotten how much time I can waste. On the other hand, I never ate so healthy. I never drank so less coffee. I never spent so much time close to nature, away from air conditioning.</p>
<h2 id="do-i-want-to-go-back">Do I want to go back?</h2>
<p>Well, this is really hard to say. I am not the same person who I was before March 2020. Assuming that I&rsquo;&rsquo;l be required to go back to an office, I don&rsquo;t want to forget what I learnt at home. So here is what I want to remind my future self. Working in an office is more predictable. Working from home is not. But that is what makes it more valuable. I think working from home has much more potential for your personal evolution. You&rsquo;ll be more frustrated or more happy or more thoughtful. Whatever it is, you won&rsquo;t be stuck in the same place. You&rsquo;ll make bigger plans than before. You&rsquo;ll have deeper realizations than before. And sometimes you&rsquo;ll get way more work done than you ever did inside an office.</p>
