      <title>Joel Test for 2021</title>

      <description>The Joel Test is quite famous and has inspired many programmers and organizations over the last two decades. I was highly impressed by it when I read it more than a decade ago. Nowadays I tend to think that it needs to be revised. I am not alone. If you search for &amp;lsquo;joel test&amp;rsquo; on your search engine you&amp;rsquo;ll probably see a handful of posts which try to describe a modified version of the test as appropriate for a more recent year (the original test was published in 2000).</description>

      <title>Developer Productivity - I</title>

      <description>I used to be very passionate about developer productivity for years. I guess I still am. But my outlook and methods have changed a lot. I want to write all this down before I forget it. Yes, my memory is short.
Ten years ago I had just joined a medium-sized company from a tiny startup and I immediately began noticing how much my productivity had come down. And I found fault with the tools and the version control system being used.</description>

      <description>Today is the last day of my batch - that&amp;rsquo;s how fast a Mini batch flies by. Let me recap what happened in the last two days
Interaction with Recursers I had another great coffee chat where we talked about things like the birdsong recognition contest at Kaggle and how remote participation in RC can be more fun. I also got good questions about security in my homesocial project, which I hadn&amp;rsquo;t thought of before.</description>

      <description>So now I am at the end of day 3 of this batch - which means more than half is over! A lot has happened that I want to write about, although I have made very little progress on the side projects I planned to work on. Like the previous post, I am organizing this one by theme.
Interaction with Recursers This is going really well - again, by my own standards.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was the first day of my second mini batch at the Recurse Center. This time I am attending a remote batch, which in itself is a new experience. I had the time to think and plan my time for this batch, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have arrange transport or accommodation. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how much of the plan I am following, but I guess I am not too much off track.</description>

      <description>I am going to do my second ever batch at the Recurse Center - yay &amp;#x1F601; ! I will attend the Mini 6 2020 batch from August 10 to 14. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think this would ever happen, I am able to do this only because right now it is possible to attend remotely.
My first ever batch was Mini 5 2018, and I started this blog at that time (I had a few blogspot.</description>

      <title>Making the Same Mistake for a Decade</title>

      <guid>https://debamitro.github.io/blog/making-the-same-mistake-for-a-decade/</guid>
      <description>Today I saw I had made the same mistake twice in a month. It is a rather harmless-looking mistake in C.
I first saw it in 2006, barely a year after I started working as a software engineer. Someone was having a crash only with a 64-bit build. Two people were looking into it and I somehow got involved. A function was returning a pointer to a structure and dereferencing this pointer was causing a crash.</description>

      <title>How I Got Into Clojure</title>
      <link>https://debamitro.github.io/blog/how-i-got-into-clojure/</link>

      <guid>https://debamitro.github.io/blog/how-i-got-into-clojure/</guid>
      <description>I had read wonderful things about Clojure many years ago in a blog post series. At that time it seemed very different from the type of programming I used to do at my day job. I had no idea that it could be used for creating any of the software programs I used.
StrangeLoop and Alda I attended StrangeLoop for the first time in 2017 - and my mind was blown.</description>

      <title>An in-home Social Network</title>

      <description>I was thinking about creating social networks for specific purposes, when one day I figured out it would be good to have a social network restricted to my home. I got this idea looking at my son and thinking what he would do on Facebook a few years from now. I have nothing against Facebook or any social network - I think they are all fabulous. I just think that an internet-based social network is like the world outside your home.</description>

      <description>After a lot of thought and planning I came down to RC for two days, alongwith a fellow Recurser from Boston.
Recap In 2018 I did a mini batch at RC and simply loved it! I did not like staying away from my nine-month-old son for five days, though. So I decided against doing another batch for a year or two.
NGW 2019 I attended Never Graduate Week with my wife (a senior Recurser) and son and loved the experience!</description>

      <description>(My notes from the final day of RC Mini 5 batch)
8:39 am Today is the last day of my batch. I plan to spend the day exploring some codebases. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend a lot of time writing code today. I might write some fun code, though.
11:08 am I tried to read the alda codebase to find out where they specify frequencies of notes. Alda was my first exposure to Clojure, and I had wanted to experiment with the frequencies of the notes to see if I could play accurate Indian classical music.</description>

      <description>(My notes from the fourth day of RC Mini 5 batch)
9:47 am I started a bit late today, and got delayed by having to skip one subway train because it was soooo crowded. I am beginning to feel that although I have completed most of my work in Clojure, I haven&amp;rsquo;t done functional programming yet. I have not used any global state, and accomplished everything by calling a series of functions from other functions.</description>

      <description>(My notes from the third day of RC Mini 5 batch)
8:19 am I have been reading The Joy of Clojure everyday. I need to find ways to improve my Clojure code. So far I have succeeded in avoiding loops by using recursion. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to operate on lists as a whole yet, and neither have I been able to use things like the continuation-passing-style. I can&amp;rsquo;t use something &amp;lsquo;foo&amp;rsquo; unless the code stares at me in the face and says &amp;ldquo;this is the place to try out foo&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>(My notes from the second day of RC Mini 5 batch)
7:58 am I have been up since 6:30am. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get started with today at RC. I have been thinking about how to process a variable number of characters from a string in Clojure. I keep getting stuck because I still have the C++ while loop code in my head!
10:10 am I was the first person in RC today.</description>

      <description>9:15 am I woke up at my usual time of somewhere-between-6:30-and-7:00. Thanks to my son I don&amp;rsquo;t need alarms! I headed out after an hour in search of Dr Strange&amp;rsquo;s Sanctum Sanctorum. I went to 177A Bleecker St - there was no house with that address. I was helped by an &amp;#9730; in my search. I took a photo of the shop at 177. Now I am about to head to RC after a small breakfast.</description>

      <description>10:57 am I am going to the Recurse Center. Can&amp;rsquo;t believe it yet. Right now I am sitting in the bus and heading towards Boston&amp;rsquo;s South Station. Two years ago my wife did a full batch at RC and that changed her life. It changed my life as well - I became convinced that RC was a &amp;ldquo;must-do&amp;rdquo;. It would not have been possible for me to do a full batch unless I quit my job, so my only hope was a half batch which lasts six weeks.</description>
