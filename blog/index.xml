      <description>(My notes from the second day of RC Mini 5 batch)
7:58 am I have been up since 6:30am. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get started with today at RC. I have been thinking about how to process a variable number of characters from a string in Clojure. I keep getting stuck because I still have the C++ while loop code in my head!
10:10 am I was the first person in RC today.</description>

      <description>9:15 am I woke up at my usual time of somewhere-between-6:30-and-7:00. Thanks to my son I don&amp;rsquo;t need alarms! I headed out after an hour in search of Dr Strange&amp;rsquo;s Sanctum Sanctorum. I went to 177A Bleecker St - there was no house with that address. I was helped by an &amp;#9730; in my search. I took a photo of the shop at 177. Now I am about to head to RC after a small breakfast.</description>

      <description>10:57 am I am going to the Recurse Center. Can&amp;rsquo;t believe it yet. Right now I am sitting in the bus and heading towards Boston&amp;rsquo;s South Station. Two years ago my wife did a full batch at RC and that changed her life. It changed my life as well - I became convinced that RC was a &amp;ldquo;must-do&amp;rdquo;. It would not have been possible for me to do a full batch unless I quit my job, so my only hope was a half batch which lasts six weeks.</description>
