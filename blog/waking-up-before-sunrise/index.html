        <h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>I had been seeing videos on YouTube about highly successful people waking up at 4:00 am or 4:30 am or even earlier. About ten days ago I discovered that my neighbour wakes up at 4:00 am every day. That got me thinking - this is a real example in front of me. This can&rsquo;t be some random stuff from the Internet. I had to dig deeper into this. So I decided to try out waking up before sunrise. What follows is my log for the first few days of this attempt.</p>
<h1 id="before-i-started">Before I started</h1>
<p>I tried to imagine what I would do, if I managed to wake up very early. First I thought I&rsquo;d try to get ahead on office work, particularly the tedious parts. I quickly did a thought experiment and realized this would be quite bad. The whole point of getting up extra early is to <em>not</em> start your day like you would otherwise. So I thought I&rsquo;d try to be flexible about what I do. As long as I didn&rsquo;t do anything that <em>needed</em> to be done - I had the whole day to tend to those things.</p>
<h1 id="day-1">Day 1</h1>
<h2 id="at-130-pm">At 1:30 pm</h2>
<p>I woke up at 5:00am today, and I am still awake. I never thought this would be possible for me.</p>
<h2 id="at-3-pm">At 3 pm</h2>
<p>Well, I just woke up from a 40-minute nap which my wife forced me to take. I guess I was looking like a zombie earlier. I don&rsquo;t really know if I am any different now.</p>
<h2 id="at-830-pm">At 8:30 pm</h2>
<p>It was an interesting day. I survived, but was thinking quite slowly most of the time. I also felt less hungry. Luckily I can go to bed in the next hour &hellip;</p>
<h1 id="day-2">Day 2</h1>
<h2 id="at-6-am">At 6 am</h2>
<p>I have been up for a little more than an hour. I just did a few burpees, which I have found to be a great way to start feeling awake. Like yesterday, I didn&rsquo;t rush anything and allowed my drowsiness to slowly wear off.</p>
<h2 id="at-130-pm-1">At 1:30 pm</h2>
<p>Today I was feeling less energetic in the morning. Then the sun came out and I walked about two miles and that got me much closer to being normal. Right now I contemplating taking a nap &hellip;</p>
<h2 id="at-8-pm">At 8 pm</h2>
<p>I did nap for an hour just like yesterday. It took that and a coffee and a trip to two playgrounds with my son to get me somewhere close to normal.</p>
<h1 id="day-3">Day 3</h1>
<p>Last evening I managed to work a wee little bit before going to bed. The previous evening I was not capable of doing that. Today has been better than the last two days. I think I am gradually getting to know the do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts of waking up early. I do notice that on all three days my breathing is slightly different, and my hunger is less than usual. My apetite is intact - I ate the same amount of food as I usually do. It is only the &lsquo;feed me&rsquo; message which isn&rsquo;t flashing through my mind. Perhaps my mind doesn&rsquo;t have enough power to do that!</p>
<h2 id="at-2-pm">At 2 pm</h2>
<p>The last two days I have been napping at this time. Today I feel like I might be able to survive without a nap. However I don&rsquo;t want to simply collapse later in the afternoon. So I might just take a precautionary nap.</p>
<h2 id="at-930-pm">At 9:30 pm</h2>
<p>Today the afternoon and evening felt almost normal. Even now I feel slightly drowsy but not very weak. I am going to bed nevertheless.</p>
<h1 id="day-4">Day 4</h1>
<h2 id="at-630-am">At 6:30 am</h2>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t plan to wake up today, I didn&rsquo;t even set my alarm. However sometime around 5:17 am I felt fresh and awake. So I got up as usual.</p>
<h2 id="at-230-pm">At 2:30 pm</h2>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been working much today. I had a long video call with my parents back in India. There was also some house-related work to do. I think I am going to skip my nap today, because there&rsquo;s no time.</p>
<h2 id="at-930-pm-1">At 9:30 pm</h2>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t avoid my nap after all. I am, however, able to do a little bit of work now. Probably the first day I can do this.</p>
<h1 id="fast-forward-to-today">Fast forward to today</h1>
<p>It has been more than 7 days since I started, and I think I like this! It doesn&rsquo;t seem very difficult to do, and keeps my mind in a much more pleasant state. My body also feels lighter and my sleep is definitely better now. All good things for a programmer, as far as I can see.</p>
