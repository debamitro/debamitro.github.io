      <div class="my-page-content">
        <p>I used to be very passionate about developer productivity for years. I guess I still am. But my outlook and methods have changed a lot. I want to write all this down before I forget it. Yes, my memory is short.</p>
<h2 id="ten-years-ago">Ten years ago</h2>
<p>I had just joined a medium-sized company from a tiny startup and I immediately began noticing how much my productivity had come down. And I found fault with the tools and the version control system being used. Most of the blogs and stackoverflow posts I read confirmed my suspicions - ClearCase was the root of all suffering!</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t a cynic or a complainer - at least not back then. So I did what I could. I was a Vim user for more than five years - I learned Emacs and moved to that (I still am on emacs). I wrote scripts and automated my tedious tasks as and when needed. I tried to improve the build time of our codebase a few years later, when a very senior colleague was doing a pilot project around parallel builds.</p>
<h2 id="things-start-to-change">Things start to change</h2>
<p>After seven years in my company, I finally saw developer tooling changes. The first was a move to a new version control system (Perforce). I was surprised by how long it actually took. Then came some steps towards continuous integration. While all of this was going on I became a father and started juggling work and life for the first time. Two years passed by before I even knew it.</p>
<h2 id="getting-deeper-into-productivity-improvement">Getting deeper into productivity improvement</h2>
<p>I started noticing that my productivity was not great, even with some improvements in the tools around me. I also started thinking what productivity really meant. Eight years ago I simply wanted to produce more code changes - that was my passion. I had no problem putting in much more time at work than most of my colleagues. I didn&rsquo;t even realize I was doing that - because it never felt like that. The output I was producing mattered to me, and that was not a lot.</p>
<p>Now I started putting much more value in how much my efforts were rewarded by subsequent visible output.
In short, the new formula was</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>my_productivity = what_I_accomplish / how_much_time_I_spent_at_it
</code></pre><p>I started realizing that the way to increase this ratio had much less to do with version control systems or scripts provided to me. There are many more factors, like</p>
<ul>
<li>How many things am I trying to do at the same time?</li>
<li>How many context switches do I have in a day?</li>
<li>How physically fit am I?</li>
<li>How much sleep did I get?</li>
<li>How satisfying was my lunch or dinner?</li>
<li>Am I happy or depressed?</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these factors are in <em>my</em> control. I started to take charge of my productivity as a developer, as measured by this new formula.</p>
<h2 id="more-kinds-of-productivity">More kinds of productivity</h2>
<p>As I spent more and more time in the software industry, and in the same company, I started seeing things from a higher level. I realized that individual developer productivity may not help my team&rsquo;s productivity, or that of my company. Because, changing source code doesn&rsquo;t solve all the problems a product runs into. Well-crafted e-mails can accomplish much more at times. Such e-mails require the knowledge gathered from hundreds of hours of source code changes, and perhaps more. A coffee chat with some human beings explaining a bunch of changes before they are typed in is also very powerful at times.</p>
<p>The other way to be more productive is to be choosy in what you do. Doing the wrong thing with enormous speed won&rsquo;t get you far. The right change at the right place can work wonders.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-do-i-do">So what do I do?</h2>
<p>Even after realizing so much, I still have the desire to produce more code changes. I found out that there is a good way to do this - have side projects. At work, at your home - wherever you are. No one needs to be bothered by what you are doing. You can create a new project every few days and throw it away whenever you want to. If all of your ideas are around your work assignments - try to organize a hackathon at work. Or simply create a new branch of your source code and see where you go with your modifications. Who knows, you might come up with a new product idea for your company!</p>
<h2 id="learning">Learning</h2>
<p>Developer productivity is very important. But not more than developer sanity. The latter is probably going to be much more important for most of your life.</p>
