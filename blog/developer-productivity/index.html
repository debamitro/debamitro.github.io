<p>I have been thinking a lot about productivity as a developer for the last few months. I was forced to start thinking seriously about this after my son was born and I realized that a lot of the time in my life was going to go away forever. I am trying to create a helpful post for others in similar situations and also for my future self.</p>

<h2 id="my-developer-story">My developer story</h2>

<p>I have been a professional C/C++ developer for nearly 14 years. Looking back today I feel I have achieved much less as a developer than what I could have.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-want-to-achieve">What do I want to achieve?</h2>

<p>I should be able to create software products without spending ages trying to learn something. I should not be confined to one kind of language or eco-system.</p>

<h2 id="here-is-what-i-have-learnt">Here is what I have learnt</h2>

<h3 id="practice-practice-practice">Practice, practice, practice</h3>

<p>There is no beating practice. Whenever you try to do something without practicing for it you are setting yourself up for failure, or for innovation. The latter is much less common that the former.</p>

<h3 id="time-of-the-day">Time of the day</h3>

<p>I have felt that productivity is not the same at all times of the day. In my experience early morning, late afternoon and late night are good times for highly productive work</p>

<h3 id="alternating-work">Alternating work</h3>

<h3 id="working-linearly">Working linearly</h3>

<p>Analyzing order of complexity - linear work is fast, constant time work is fastest
Shortage of time essential - hence invent a deadline</p>
