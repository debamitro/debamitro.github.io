<p>(<em>My notes from the second day of RC Mini 5 batch</em>)</p>

<h3 id="7-58-am">7:58 am</h3>

<p>I have been up since 6:30am. Can&rsquo;t wait to get started with today at RC. I have been thinking about how to process a variable number of characters from a string in Clojure. I keep getting stuck because I still have the C++ while loop code in my head!</p>

<h3 id="10-10-am">10:10 am</h3>

<p>I was the first person in RC today. After nearly two hours of effort I have been getting some clarity at last! I never looked at my C++ program in this way. I thought I would be able to run a simple example but then I got an error at runtime in the generated Javascript code. Need to figure that out soon.</p>

<h3 id="1-56-pm">1:56 pm</h3>

<p>I just learned a useful bit of Perl from someone here. I could never figure out a way of splitting my Perl code into modules and use them without keeping them in the current working directory. What I learned was one line of Perl which allows me to use a module from any given path. I found it documented at <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/lib.html">https://perldoc.perl.org/lib.html</a> later on.</p>

<h3 id="2-02-pm">2:02 pm</h3>

<p>Yes, I got the first bit of vowel-conversion working, somehow. &ldquo;Aiu&rdquo; does get converted to &ldquo;আইউ&rdquo; although it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything.</p>

<h3 id="5-01-pm">5:01 pm</h3>

<p>After some more mind-bending Clojure-ing, I have got &ldquo;kAku&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;কাকু&rdquo; working! I have a strong feeling that I have reached here in a rather roundabout manner.</p>

<h3 id="5-15-pm">5:15 pm</h3>

<p>Figured out an unoptimized way of adding an RSS feed to my blog which is currently part of my Hugo website. I needed to do this in order to add the blog to RC&rsquo;s blog aggregator.</p>

<h3 id="5-30-pm">5:30 pm</h3>

<p>Oh no, Chrome is hanging! I hate when this happens. I have a secret hope of fixing all such problems the day I join the Chrome engineering team - just joking!</p>

<h3 id="9-00-pm">9:00 pm</h3>

<p>I have been finally able to get &ldquo;DisTrikT&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;ডিস্ট্রিক্ট&rdquo; working. I needed to think a lot and also consult Stu Halloway&rsquo;s book a number of times. I hope to simplify my Clojure code vastly some day in the future.</p>
