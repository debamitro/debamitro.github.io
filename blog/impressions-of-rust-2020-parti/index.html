        <p>Learning a new programming language is always a nice way to kick your brain into action. I first experienced this when I tried to learn Lisp by watching some video lectures. It took me months to digest the concepts and I never got around to writing any lisp. But the ideas stayed with me for years. Later on <a href="https://debamitro.github.io/blog/how-i-got-into-clojure">I did learn Clojure</a> and spend some months writing a bit of Clojure and ClojureScript. All this while I had been hearing about Rust and silently ignoring it.</p>
<p>I think I had been ignoring Rust because I write C/C++ for close-to-system products for my day job. I thought I was already wrestling with a systems programming language so why bother dabbling with the latest one. Years ago I had invested time into learning <a href="https://dlang.org">D</a>, and then left it alone even though it was very promising. Whenever I needed to write new code for a command-line application I could easily use C++. And that seemed sufficient.</p>
<h2 id="first-interesting-rust-project">First interesting Rust project</h2>
<p>The first project I saw which had me say &lsquo;whoa, Rust can be used like <em>this</em>&rsquo; was <a href="https://github.com/fabianschuiki/moore">Moore</a>. It is a compiler for Verilog and SystemVerilog. Having worked in similar proprietary products all my career I know how big and complex these are. I know the challenges of developing large C/C++ products with multiple engineers. Here was something almost as big written by very few people using a completely new systems programming language. I was used to see systems programming languages shine in small low-level tools, and become unwieldy in large products. Rust seemed quite different.</p>
<h2 id="getting-into-rust">Getting into Rust</h2>
<p>I started reading about Rust, and listening to the <a href="https://newrustacean.com">New Rustacean</a> podcast. This <a href="https://newrustacean.com/show_notes/e026/index.html">episode</a> about how Rust took some functional programming ideas and implemented them in a systems programming style gave me insights into the design of Rust. I also looked into the documentation on the website and it was very nice. I always felt that the best software system was the most well-documented one.
I also noticed that everything about Rust was designed for codebase scalability. Every programmming language gets stress tested when it is used at scale. Rust has things like</p>
<ul>
<li>a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/">package manager</a></li>
<li>a system for creating modules</li>
<li>a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html">documentation generator</a></li>
<li>a code formatter</li>
</ul>
<p>All out of the box. These are very useful features for large projects. And such features are still lacking in widely-used languages like C and C++.</p>
