        <p>Today is the last day of my batch - that&rsquo;s how fast a Mini batch flies by. Let me recap what happened in the last two days</p>
<h2 id="interaction-with-recursers">Interaction with Recursers</h2>
<p>I had another great coffee chat where we talked about things like the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/birdsong-recognition">birdsong recognition contest at Kaggle</a> and how remote participation in RC can be more fun. I also got good questions about security in my <a href="https://github.com/debamitro/homesocial">homesocial</a> project, which I hadn&rsquo;t thought of before.</p>
<h2 id="project-work">Project work</h2>
<p>I added profile pages to <a href="https://github.com/debamitro/homesocial">homesocial</a>, although they are pretty basic now - with only a name and a description. I also added login buttons for everyone who has a profile. The earlier way of logging in with any name still works.</p>
<p>After this was done I spent most of my time making slides and a demo for a presentation on it. Making the demo was real fun, because it involved a hypothetical conversation among a baby and his parents over the in-home social network.</p>
<h3 id="reflection-on-project-work">Reflection on project work</h3>
<p>What I liked the most about my project work in my batch is that I was building an entire system end-to-end, and on top of that I was deciding what to implement. The technical challenges were not huge, but the autonomy I got made me very happy.</p>
<h2 id="other-stuff">Other stuff</h2>
<p>I browsed through <a href="https://github.com/fabianschuiki/moore">moore</a> in Visual Studio Code, after installing rust-analyzer. I must say I am pretty much blown away by VSCode. After emacs this is the first time I encountered a development environment which had so much useful stuff bundled by default. Not only does VSCode have suitable features for every language, it is quite fast - even on my 2012 MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>I also discovered that <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/home.php">the creator of Tcl</a> was also the co-founder of Electric Cloud, and part of the team which implemented Raft. Having used Tcl and Electric Accelerator, and having heard enough about Raft from people interested in distributed programming - I was surprised to find the same person behind all of these.</p>
<h2 id="the-end-for-now">The end, for now</h2>
<p>I looked at my <a href="https://debamitro.github.io/blog/planning-for-rc-mini6-2020/">plan for this batch</a> and realized that I didn&rsquo;t do most of the things I planned. But I think I did the important ones.
All in all I had a lovely week and met some really nice people. I&rsquo;ll end this batch saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back&rdquo;</p>
