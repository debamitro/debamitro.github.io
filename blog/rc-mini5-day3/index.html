        <p>(<em>My notes from the third day of RC Mini 5 batch</em>)</p>
<h3 id="819-am">8:19 am</h3>
<p>I have been reading The Joy of Clojure everyday. I need to find ways to improve my Clojure code. So far I have succeeded in avoiding loops by using recursion. I haven&rsquo;t been able to operate on lists as a whole yet, and neither have I been able to use things like the continuation-passing-style. I can&rsquo;t use something &lsquo;foo&rsquo; unless the code stares at me in the face and says &ldquo;this is the place to try out foo&rdquo;. I think I need to re-read the portions of the book I read last night, and also re-read my code.</p>
<p>Looking back at my time at RC till now I have spent most of it in Clojure. And I have been loving my journey. It will be good if I can figure out how to do some general-purpose tasks in Clojure, e.g., reading files, collecting data, making HTTP requests etc.</p>
<h3 id="1152-am">11:52 am</h3>
<p>I had to take a light nap on the bean bag at around 9 o&rsquo;clock - I think today will be a low-energy day. It was bound to happen after the way I have been super excited and super working for the last two days. I read Stuart Halloway&rsquo;s book a bit, and then had a long discussion with someone who is working on visualizing functional programming. She gave me some good ideas for simplify my Clojure code. Talking to her I also realized some directions in which I should go with my code.</p>
<p>Someone else suggested using Parinfer with Atom as my editing environment. Maybe I&rsquo;ll try that out someday.</p>
<h3 id="253-am">2:53 am</h3>
<p>I just saw some awesome use of css and even more mind-blowing use of p5.js! The results are interactive visualizations which work in the browser. I need to get back to Clojure-ing after feelings checkin.</p>
<h3 id="616-pm">6:16 pm</h3>
<p>I am just back from a conversation about parallel programming in different languages. It would be good to understand how Clojure helps a programmer launch parallel jobs. Someday!</p>
<h3 id="700-pm">7:00 pm</h3>
<p>I packaged my work into a demo which I have added to <a href="http://debamitro.github.io/generate-bangla-utf8-cljs-demo/">http://debamitro.github.io/generate-bangla-utf8-cljs-demo/</a>. I just checked that &ldquo;hu^ko mukho hyA;lA bArhi tAr bA;lA&rdquo; does get converted to &ldquo;হুঁকো মুখো হ্যাংলা বাড়ি তার বাংলা&rdquo;. I have also started simplifying my code.</p>
<h3 id="1115-pm">11:15 pm</h3>
<p>I tried my application with a string consisting of 10000 repetitions of &ldquo;hAhA&rdquo;. It took a long time but didn&rsquo;t overflow the stack. I have not been able to use tail call recursion yet. I have been trying to. I have, however, succeeded in using some functions to generate other functions. And I hope to be able to shrink my code some more.</p>
