<h3 id="9-15-am">9:15 am</h3>

<p>I woke up at my usual time of somewhere-between-6:30-and-7:00. Thanks to my son I don&rsquo;t need alarms! I headed out after an hour in search of Dr Strange&rsquo;s Sanctum Sanctorum. I went to 177A Bleecker St - there was no house with that address. I was helped by an &#9730; in my search. I took a photo of the shop at 177. Now I am about to head to RC after a small breakfast. Feeling very excited for the first day.</p>

<h3 id="2-02-pm">2:02 pm</h3>

<p>I am finally sitting down to start my planned project. I have also got Stu Halloway&rsquo;s &lsquo;Programming Clojure&rsquo; with me. I am overly well-fed - I ate chicken over rice from Soho&rsquo;s best Halal Cart. It is a dish worth dying for.</p>

<h3 id="4-39-pm">4:39 pm</h3>

<p>I have been able to create a small starter ClojureScript project which can attach a handler to the click event of a button. It was surprisingly hard to do even though I knew how to accomplish the same thing in pure Javascript and HTML. Thanks to all the people who have created resources like <a href="http://cljs.info/cheatsheet/">The ClojureScript Cheatsheet</a> and <a href="http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/">http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/</a> and the Clojure/ClojureScript websites. You all are so very helpful. I wish there were useful resources like this for other stuff in life, and in offices.</p>

<p>I could actually print one UTF-8 encoded Bangla character to an HTML document using my app written so far. I have pushed the code to my new github repo <a href="https://github.com/debamitro/generate-bangla-utf8-cljs">https://github.com/debamitro/generate-bangla-utf8-cljs</a></p>

<h3 id="6-48-pm">6:48 pm</h3>

<p>I have started writing the core of my application - the actual part which will convert Bangla transliterated using English to Unicode UTF-8. I took a small walk, and also consulted three books on Clojure - Programming Clojure, The Joy of Clojure and Clojure for the Brave and True. I think I am going to stick with the same namespace prefix for my code.</p>

<h3 id="10-17-pm">10:17 pm</h3>

<p>I might try to get a little bit of my application working. When I left RC I had it in a state where I could transliterate a few consonants.</p>

<h3 id="10-35-pm">10:35 pm</h3>

<p>I think I am waaaay too tired &#128564;.</p>
