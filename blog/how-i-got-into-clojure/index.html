        <p>I had read wonderful things about Clojure many years ago in a <a href="https://swaroopch.com/2013/08/24/ghoseb-clojure-course-day-1/">blog post series</a>. At that time it seemed very different from the type of programming I used to do at my day job. I had no idea that it could be used for creating any of the software programs I used.</p>
<h2 id="strangeloop-and-alda">StrangeLoop and Alda</h2>
<p>I attended <a href="https://www.thestrangeloop.com">StrangeLoop</a> for the first time in 2017 - and my mind was blown. I somehow picked up an intention to explore functional programming languages. This had never happened to me before. I mean, I was curious about functional programming, and had listened to lectures available on youtube, including some chapters of SICP. But nothing ever felt like something I was capable of trying out.</p>
<p>One of the most memorable sessions for me that year in StrangeLoop was an unsession on <a href="https://github.com/alda-lang/alda">Alda</a> by Dave Yarwood. I downloaded Alda, ran it, played with it, and looked at the source code. And then I realized - wow, this language is beautiful as well as powerful, because it can execute anything from any Java library.</p>
<h2 id="learning-clojure">Learning clojure</h2>
<p>I started learning Clojure a while before my son was born. I picked up steam after he arrived, because I was not working and also barely sleeping. I had to keep my mind active in order to stay awake. I had my iPhone in one hand most of the time and I used to read the <a href="https://www.clojure.org">clojure website</a> on the web browser. The documentation and the guides are very nice and the format is mobile-friendly. I rarely got time to sit in front of a laptop, but ideas were getting clear in my head before I ever started typing. I realized this is a good way of learning for me.</p>
<h2 id="leiningen-vs-the-ants">Leiningen vs The Ants</h2>
<p>I had started using leiningen, and I noticed the picture of Leiningen on the <a href="https://leiningen.org">leiningen project&rsquo;s website</a>. It is an impressive picture, and it made me curious enough to find out the story behind the name. I read the story <a href="https://www.classicshorts.com/stories/lvta.html">&lsquo;Leiningen Versus The Ants&rsquo; by Carl Stephenson</a>. I cannot recommend this story enough - it made me confident that leiningen was the right choice for doing anything in Clojure. The story is also very inspirational - it gives your courage to face any adversity in life.</p>
<h2 id="reagent">Reagent</h2>
<p>I went to a few monthly events of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Boston-Clojure-Group/">Boston Clojure Meetup group</a>. The first time I went there I attended an excellent session on <a href="https://reagent-project.github.io">Reagent</a> and the design pattern behind it - which is of course the same as the one behind ReactJS. This is also the first time I heard of Bret Victor and his talks.</p>
<h2 id="recurse-center">Recurse Center</h2>
<p>The real test of what I had learnt so far was my project in the Recurse Center mini batch I attended, in 2018. I tried to convert a small C++ program of mine to ClojureScript. I guess I succeeded in one sense - I could produce a browser-based program which did the exact same thing. I was not at all happy with my ClojureScript code, and I realized I had a long way to go before I could write &lsquo;Clojure&rsquo;-ish code.</p>
<h2 id="full-circle---alda-again">Full circle - Alda again</h2>
<p>This story which started with Alda came back to Alda again this year when I went to StrangeLoop 2019. This time Dave had <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/2019/aldas-dynamic-relationship-with-clojure.html">a session on Alda</a>, in which he described how a large part of Alda had been rewritten in Go. I don&rsquo;t know if this will lead me to Go next!</p>
